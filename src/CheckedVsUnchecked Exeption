Q4) Explain the difference between Checked and Unchecked exception?
A4) Checked Exception: this classes are directly inherit from throwable class.this exception
    are checked at compile time by java compiler.We have to handle this exception to run our application.
    Sqlexception,IOexception this are Checked Exception.This Exception is also called compile-time exception.
    Unchecked Exception:this classes are directly inherit from RuntimeException are called Unchecked Exception.
    ArithmeticException, NullPointerException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException this are Unchecked Exception.
    Without handling this exception we can run this program.So at compile time this exceptions are not
    checked.so in result it will give a runtime error.
